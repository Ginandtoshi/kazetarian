This project was part of Radio Chthulucene 1

Experimental Poetic and Hertzian waves on bespoke transmission technologies for local frequency modulation. The peripatetic and the unlicensed. Zombie tones are not made alone, it takes a village to raise a golem. And their kins. A talking house full of haunted pasts, no longer self sufficient but instead of co-making. These are the sounds of the Chthulucene.

For the first time, Monday June 3rd through Friday the 7th, 2024.
